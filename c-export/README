This package provides a C-callable API for the saw-core package. The
easiest way to build C programs that use it, for the moment, is to
compile them using GHC. In the future, we plan to add scripts to build a
single .a file that can be linked into a C program, with a minimum of
fuss, using only gcc. That doesn't exist yet, though.

For now, to build using GHC, use cabal or cabal-dev to install the
saw-core package, and then this package (saw-export). Once both packages
are installed, the Makefile and test_export.c files in the test
directory illustrate how to build a simple C program that calls
functions from the saw-core package.
